# News Site
This project is about creating a responsive (music)magazine website using flexbox. Elements included are: heather with a logo and navigation, section with a main article and another section with subnews. 

The subnews are linked to their seperate html and on there the "home"-button is linked. So you can click around and get back to the index.html.

## The problem

The first problem I stumbled over was to get into the "thinking in (flex)box/es". I got to my layout by trying out different code snippets until it looked like the sketches (for phone, tablet and desktop) I did on paper before starting coding. Trying out without understanding my doing resulted in a messy code, which I didn't understand in its function and wasn't readable for others. So as a next step i focused on working on a clearer code, which of course messed up my layout again, but helped me extremely to understand the function of the flexboxmodel, building classes and refer to them in the css. I added my classes, sections on my sketches, which helped me to stay on track while working on my already written code. I think I now can offer a simple and readable code. 

With the little time i had left I worked on my styling and layouting. I added another breakingpoint in the mediaquery so now it works even on screens >1200px. Further I just played around with sizes, colors (found a tool in chrome which helps finding a matching color from pictures) and a very simple hover effect. 

If I had more time to work on my project I would have worked on my hover effects. Made the one in the navbar better looking and another one for the subnews (like making them sizing bigger when hover over them). Now I have just one hovereffect for all links. Would have been nice to have different ones.
Also I would have added a "hamburger-navigation" on the phone-size.
