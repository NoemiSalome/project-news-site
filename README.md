# Bootcamp-Project #01: News Site
The project was about getting the basics to work with: html, css, vs code, the terminal. The task was to create a responsive magazine website using flexbox. Elements included are: heather with a logo and navigation, section with a main article and another section with subnews. 

## Learning content and lessons learned: 
- HTML & CSS
- Boxmodel
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design
- planning and structuring a project (sketches)
- working with commands in the terminal
- github

I started out by sketching the project for mobile, tablet and desktop on paper. During the process I also added classes to the sketch for styling purposes. It made it easier for me to work with flexbox in the beginning. I learned how important a proper planning is to not end up trying out code snippets and keep on changing the code during the process, but to code more goal oriented. So for future projects, I'll start with coding after heaving a clearer goal in mind. Changing a code later or "clean" the code after, is much more work than spending some time on planning in the beginning.
