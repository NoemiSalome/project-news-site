<h3>Foxwarren</h3>
<p>Foxwarren’s backstory reads like a page torn from the manual of rock & roll authenticity, as this group of siblings and childhood 
friends originally formed more than a decade ago. Growing up in scattered small towns across the Canadian prairies, Andy Shauf 
(guitars/keys/vocals), Dallas Bryson (guitar/vocals), and brothers Darryl Kissick (bass) and Avery Kissick (drums & percussion) 
eventually found themselves in Regina, Saskatchewan. The initial sessions for their self-titled debut began in the Kissicks’ 
parents’ farmhouse while they were away on vacation. Upon their return, Foxwarren were forced to relocate and recording resumed 
back in Regina in a rented house where the members lived as roommates. The band's name comes from the Kissick brothers’ family 
home in Foxwarren, Manitoba.</p>
