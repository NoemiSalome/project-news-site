<h3>Celeste</h3>
<p class="author">by Noemi, 01.01.2021</p>
       <p>If British singer-songwriter Celeste isn’t already on your radar, chances are you’ll be her biggest fan by the end of the year. 
       The 26-year-old artist recently won BBC’s Sound of 2020, and took home the Brit Rising Star Award—a kind of barometer of future success (previous winners include Sam Smith, Haim, and Adele).
       “I find those things really encouraging, but I try not to let it go to my head too much,” Celeste told Vogue. “There’s still a lot more to do.”
       Celeste is laying a bit of that groundwork with her new single “I Can See The Change,” produced by recent Grammy winner Finneas. 
       Despite the video’s humble production—it was filmed during quarantine in Celeste’s living room (with the help of her roommate) 
       and directed by Sophie Jones via Zoom—the black-and-white clip is the singer’s most evocative visual to date. Channeling the old-school 
       glamour of classic film noir, Celeste sings of her desire for change in many forms alongside footage from a 1963 Martin Luther King Jr. 
       rally: “I can see the change / Come what may, I won’t regret today / I am what remains / Standing here in spite of everything.”</p>
