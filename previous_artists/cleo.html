<p class="author">by Noemi, 01.01.2021</p>
<p>20 year old Cleo Sol was born to musical parents who met in a Jazz band. Her Mum, half Serbian and Spanish, is a singer and plays 
the guitar and flute. Cleoâ€™s Jamaican Dad plays the bass and piano. Cleo quickly became the singer in the family, jostling for attention 
amongst seven other siblings, she received a second hand karaoke player from her mum which gave her a platform to display her early 
talents to her musical family.</p>
