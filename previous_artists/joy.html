<h3>Joy Crookes</h3>
    <p>Joy Crookes is 19 year old south London born songstress straddling soul, trip-hop and R&B. Half-Bengali/Half-Irish in heritage; 
        Joy’s is a dexterous sound, which effortlessly showcases her melting pot of sonic influences. Joy balances the retro stylings of 
        Sade with the millennial wit of Lily Allen – songs that aren’t afraid to be honest and raw, while also packing a political punch. 
        She may be looking to the past, but smart, talented and strong, she is shaping the sound of the future.</p>
